## Use in Curriculum

For more information, see [Supplementary Materials for Radiation and Atomic Literacy for Nonscientists](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2013/10/23/342.6157.436.DC1/123003-Johnson-SM.pdf)

Using the Atom Invaders simulator students shoot radiation at individual nitrogen atoms or N2 molecules and observe the results. This simulator also enables a very crude investigation of how ionizing energy varies for each electron removed from the atom.

#### Controls

 - Press the `S` key to scan an atom.
 - Press the `Z` key to zoom into an atom's nucleus.
